# Tetravex
An implementation of the Tetravex game in Java

This program was created for two purposes. First, I enjoyed playing Tetravex in Linux (the gnome-tetravex game provided by most distributions) and was disappointed that no comparable applications were available for Windows or macOS.  

This game produces a 3x3, 4x4, or 5x5 puzzle.
